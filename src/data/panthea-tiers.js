// floor (গ্রাউন্ড) at sea level, and a 1000-floor underworld (পাতাল, 4 km deep)

// n sits at 4n metres up, patal floor n at 4n metres down — floor for floor,
// boundary for boundary. In *plan* the two worlds are not twins; see the
// geometry note below.
//
// Both worlds are divided into fourteen segments that thin toward the
// extremes (wide neighbourhoods near the ground, small ones at summit and
// nadir), so no segment holds more than 100 floors. The segments carry only
// their numbers for now; they will be named as the stories are written.
//
// This file is the single source of truth: the map-TOC SVGs on /panthea/, the
// floor routes (/panthea/minar/[floor], /panthea/patal/[floor], /panthea/bhumi)
// and the floor-page headers all derive from it.

// ── Plan geometry — the section, designed rather than assumed ──
// Circular in plan at every level, so a floor is fully described by one
// number: its envelope diameter, measured at the floor's mid-height. The
// profile is not a straight cone. Four things set it, and none of them is a
// straight line:
//
//   1. THE SPINE. One shaft runs the whole 8 km, summit to nadir — a 60 m
//      drum holding 24 ropeless maglev guideways in a ring (12 climbing, 12
//      falling, cars circulating in a loop, ~20 m/s → some seven minutes end
//      to end) around a 16 m pressurised column of stairs, air, water, power.
//      Nothing else in প্যান্থিয়া touches every floor. It never tapers: it is
//      the datum the two worlds are hung on.
//   2. THE TIP FOLLOWS FROM THE SPINE. Both ends close at 100 m — the core
//      plus a 20 m landing gallery all round, the least a floor can be and
//      still be a floor. The summit crown and the nadir's last cell are the same
//      size, and that is the one plan dimension the two worlds share.
//   3. ABOVE, THE LIMIT IS WIND, NOT WEIGHT. At 4 km, gravity is not what
//      shapes a tower — with modern high-strength concrete the base need only
//      be some 1.8× the crown's area to carry it. Overturning is. So the
//      মিনার stands on a 1600 m base (1 : 2.5 against its height, stout by any
//      standard) and tapers on a power curve, p = 1.6: a flared root that
//      stiffens the first kilometre, a long gentle spire above, and a
//      continuously changing diameter that never lets the wind settle into
//      one shedding frequency. The wide lower plates are read as rings and
//      light-wells, not slabs — no habitable room sits 800 m from a window.
//   4. BELOW, THE LIMIT IS ROCK. Free span at depth is governed by the
//      overburden: ~106 MPa of vertical stress at 4 km. So the পাতাল is not
//      the মিনার upside down. It opens as a 600 m well through the island's
//      crust — narrow, because the tower's foundation ring has to land on
//      solid ground outside it, and because a well that size still drops
//      daylight into the patal's upper floors — then swells beneath the crust to a 1400 m belly
//      at 600 m depth, where the rock is strong and unloaded, and tapers away
//      from there as stress climbs. A flask, not a cone.

// the jetties and docks are. So the ground plate is the widest thing in the section
